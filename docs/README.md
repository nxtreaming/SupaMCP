# MCP Server Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains documentation for the MCP Server, a high-performance server for the MCP (Modular Content Protocol) protocol. The documentation covers various aspects of the server, including its architecture, API, and implementation details.

## Contents

- [KMCP Module](kmcp.md): Documentation for the KMCP module, a lightweight MCP client library that provides a high-level interface for communicating with MCP servers.
- [Template Optimization](template_optimization.md): Documentation for the optimized template implementation, which provides significant performance improvements for template matching and parameter extraction.
- [Cache Implementation](cache_implementation.md): Documentation for the resource cache implementation, which stores and retrieves content items to improve performance and reduce load on backend systems.
- [JSON Utility Functions](json_utils.md): Documentation for the JSON utility functions, which provide a convenient API for working with JSON data.

## Getting Started

If you're new to the MCP Server, we recommend starting with the following documents:

1. [KMCP Module](kmcp.md): Learn about the KMCP module and how to use it to communicate with MCP servers.
2. [Template Optimization](template_optimization.md): Learn about the optimized template implementation and how it improves performance.
3. [Cache Implementation](cache_implementation.md): Learn about the resource cache implementation and how it improves performance.
4. [JSON Utility Functions](json_utils.md): Learn about the JSON utility functions and how they make working with JSON data easier.

## Contributing
