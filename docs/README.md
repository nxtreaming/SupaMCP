# MCP Server Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains documentation for the MCP Server, a high-performance server for the MCP (Modular Content Protocol) protocol. The documentation covers various aspects of the server, including its architecture, API, and implementation details.

## Contents

- [Template Optimization](template_optimization.md): Documentation for the optimized template implementation, which provides significant performance improvements for template matching and parameter extraction.
- [Cache Implementation](cache_implementation.md): Documentation for the resource cache implementation, which stores and retrieves content items to improve performance and reduce load on backend systems.
- [JSON Utility Functions](json_utils.md): Documentation for the JSON utility functions, which provide a convenient API for working with JSON data.
- [HTTP Protocol](http_protocol.md): Documentation for the HTTP protocol implementation in MCP Server.
