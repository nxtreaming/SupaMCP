   - System tests: `tests/system`
   - Performance tests: `tests/performance`

2. Add the test to the CMake configuration:
   ```cmake
   add_test(NAME new_test COMMAND new_test_executable)
   ```

### Updating Existing Tests

1. Modify the test file in the appropriate directory.
2. Update the test plan document if necessary.

### Test Automation
