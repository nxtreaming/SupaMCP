# WebSocket Server Transport Implementation Fix Summary

## Problem Description

In the previous refactoring, we removed the logic for handling length-prefixed messages in the WebSocket server, causing the server to incorrectly process client messages with length prefixes. According to the logs, client messages contained a 4-byte length prefix, but the server could not correctly parse these messages.

## Fix Content

1. **Restored Length Prefix Processing Logic**
   - Re-added code to detect and process 4-byte length prefixes
   - When a length prefix is detected, the prefix is skipped and only the actual message content is processed
   - Added detailed logging for debugging purposes

2. **Improved Message Processing Flow**
   - Ensured immediate processing of message content after handling length prefixes
   - Added complete message processing logic, including thread-local memory initialization, message callback invocation, and response sending
   - Ensured correct handling of message fragments and complete messages

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Added more error checks and logging
   - Ensured proper resource cleanup when errors occur
   - Improved memory management to avoid memory leaks

## Test Results

After the fix, the WebSocket server should correctly process client messages with length prefixes and return appropriate responses. This resolves the previous issue where clients could not receive server responses.

## Future Improvements

1. **Unified Message Format**
   - Consider standardizing the message format between client and server to avoid using length prefixes
   - Or implement consistent length prefix formats between client and server

2. **Enhanced Protocol Compatibility**
   - Add more protocol detection and adaptation logic to support different client implementations
   - Consider adding protocol version negotiation mechanisms

3. **Improved Error Recovery**
   - Add more robust error recovery mechanisms to handle protocol mismatches and other exceptional situations
   - Implement more detailed error reporting and diagnostic capabilities
