# WebSocket Client Transport Refactoring and Optimization

## Overview

The WebSocket client transport implementation has been refactored and optimized to improve reliability, performance, and maintainability. The changes focus on better connection management, message handling, error recovery, and thread safety.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Connection Management
- Added a proper state machine for connection states (DISCONNECTED, CONNECTING, CONNECTED, CLOSING, ERROR)
- Implemented robust reconnection with exponential backoff
- Added proper mutex protection for connection state changes
- Improved connection timeout handling

### 2. Message Queue for Outgoing Messages
- Added a thread-safe message queue for outgoing messages
- Messages are now queued and sent when the connection is established
- Implemented proper message handling in the WebSocket callback
- Added support for both text and binary message types

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Added more detailed error reporting
- Improved cleanup in error cases
- Added timeout handling for operations
- Better handling of connection failures

### 4. Thread Safety Enhancements
- Ensured all shared data is properly protected by mutexes
- Implemented proper synchronization for connection state changes
- Added thread-safe message queuing
- Improved resource cleanup

### 5. Code Structure Improvements
- Refactored common code into helper functions
- Improved code organization and readability
- Added more detailed comments
- Better initialization and cleanup of resources

## Testing

The refactored WebSocket client transport can be tested using the existing `examples/websocket_client.c` and `examples/websocket_server.c` examples. The client should now be more resilient to connection issues and should automatically reconnect when the connection is lost.

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements could include:
- Adding support for WebSocket ping/pong for connection health monitoring
- Implementing a configurable message retry mechanism
- Adding support for WebSocket extensions
- Implementing a more sophisticated message prioritization system
